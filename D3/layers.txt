Always create layers when creating d3.

Since d3 works with svgs, they layer ontop of each other.
This causes problems when trying to work with multiple elements and removal/addition of elements.
The newest element is created as the latest/initial? element that is the very top element.

Creating layer elements and appending the layers on in the right order solves this.
Add elements to each layer element as needed.
