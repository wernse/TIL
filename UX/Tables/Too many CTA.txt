When dealing with too many CTA such as:

ProductID | Accuracy | Add | Change | Remove

1. Instead of creating having those 3 buttons repeated for every row.
This will remove overload of words of the user. Also make it look less crowded.
Think of something like G-mail where they use icons on the left:

 + | ^ | x | ProductID | Accuracy



2. add checkboxes to the left for bulk operations

3. make the options only appear when the user hoversover the row,
this is good since the user has already showed an interest in that row.
