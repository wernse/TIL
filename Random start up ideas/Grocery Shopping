#Problem
Have to look through multiple several websites to find what is the cheapest price.
I normally do it to find the lowest price for meat. My friend created a spreadsheet calculating the protein per $.
The target market would be student/budget gym goers.
People normally think that stores that target the cheap customers have the cheapest prices however this is untrue when sales occur

#Solution
Crowd scource and scrap websites for their prices
Offer an easy search and frequent items to see when they update. Speicals update every weekend
Can even go into local chinese stores.
