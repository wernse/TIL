Design your classes around behaviours rather than specific application/features
e.g. two places required me to create the same type of graphs

First abstract away the things that will be similar in the whole app.
Then build a library/class around that functionality.
Then include that class into the specific features module.

The abstraction can either be done in a factory or a directive. 
However directive is more strict on what input you need. you need a specific format.
e.g. Highcharts directive requires an object which has a large amount of nested objects
specifying what is needed.
