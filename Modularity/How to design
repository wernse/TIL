It is important to create functions/code that is re-useable

This is the reason why angular is good, it creates re-useable html

Create directives that use repetitive html so when you change one class you dont
have to change it in 4 different places
e.g. metric tiles, better to change the html in one place rather than 4 places

Create factories(classes) that are able to be reused
rather than creating a factory thats designed for one specific directive
then having to include that same factory(with obsolete code) in another directive



E.g. for highcharts its best to create functions that will take in a specific input
then you create customized functions that transform to that specific input.
this allows for greater code re-useablity for when creating the options


This is also why scss recommends creating css classes that can be reused 
e.g. lg-btn rather than moreInfoButton
