-The controller is like a manager, he does not care how/what the results are made. Uses the results to show the customers
-The factories are like machinery, able to swap them out for different functions/implementations/parts e.g.faster search

Therefore all functionality should be done in machinery and not in the controller

e.g. Factory 
function getGraph (type, data, filter) {
	if(type == 'day')
		return metricsFactory.getDayGraph(data, filter)
	else if(type == 'time')
		return metricsFactory.getTimeGraph(data, filter)
}

Could replace the metricsFactory implementation with something else and the result would be the same

Controller
 Factory.getGraph(x,x,x)

We do not need to touch the controller code at all even if we need to change the graph implementation to something better
