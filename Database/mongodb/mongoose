This is a library that imposes restrictions on the database through a schema.
Just maps the data into a json object.
You can only perform operations that are defined.
Prevents adding fields that you didnt account for.


#Mongoose Schema on the Fly
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Schema = mongoose.Schema; // <-- EDIT: missing in the original post
var Comments = new Schema({
    title     : String
  , body      : String
  , date      : Date
});
mongoose.model("Comments", Comments);

##In other files
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var Comments = mongoose.model("Comments");
Comments.find(function(err, comments) {
    // some code here
});
