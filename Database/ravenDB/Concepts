DocumentStore - Object that holds the connection string and specifies defaultDB 
e.g like mongodb connect to 'mongodb://pw:username@serverURL:27017/test'

Session - Open connection to db then perform operations
e.g. using (IDocumentSession session = store.OpenSession())
-Session implements Unit of Work pattern
  This pattern chaches db changes to send in one go instead of each individually, bulk update reduces the trips to DB, 
  if item is in memory then it will retrieve from memory not the db. e.g. save and load same obj

Store and Load Entities - Need a class("json") to retrieve entities.

var newReport = new report();
newReport.array = cleanedData
newReport.save()

vs

//creating a json structure like mongoose. Employee is the predefined "schema"
Employee employee = new Employee
{
    FirstName = "John",
    LastName = "Doe"
};

session.Store(employee); // stores employee in session, assigning it to a collection `Employees` 
string employeeId = employee.Id; // Session.Store will assign Id to employee, if it is not set

//returns a report json
report.findOne({ _id : req.body.hash}, function(err, thisReport) {

vs
//returns an employee json loaded as employee object
Employee loadedEmployee = session.Load<Employee>(employeeId);
