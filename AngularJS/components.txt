Data that does not belong to the component should not be modified in the component.
The component should call a method showing the intention from the controller e.g. Delete/Add.
This allows us to see where the data is being altered instead of having random alterations within the component's controller.

The problem is that over time, as the application grows, this kind of state mutation destroys our ability to figure out what's going on.
We get into situations where data is changing and we don't know why. The change could be made by some code we wrote 
last year, four scopes down, but there is nothing in the code that we're looking at to remind us about it.
