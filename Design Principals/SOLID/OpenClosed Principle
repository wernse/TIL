Open for extension, closed for modification if used by other modules(well-defined).
New functionality/features should extend from the original class,
not through modifiying the original class.

For example, if people rely on the original class for an API and test cases
If you implement the new functionality in the original class then it may break the original test
cases and the APIs people rely on.

Better to extend the class or get the results and then extend to create 
a new api or functionality
