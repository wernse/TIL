High level modules(functions) should not depend on low-level modules, they should depend on 
abstractions(interfaces).
Low level should depend on an input interface.
High level should depend on an output interface
Given an input, i expect this output. Therefore can swap the low and high modules out
without having to go into each function to change functionality e.g. SQL vs NOSQL
Or low level shouldnt know that high level is a mobile vs webapp
