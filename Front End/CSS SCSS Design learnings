Add your extra stlyings that wont change to the bootstrap tags, allows you to keep consistency and DRY e.g. encapsulation
e.g.
Adding custom button styles, such as background/height. These will be consistent over all your buttons


Add seperate classes for things that will change e.g. width


.btn-size-one{
  width: 160px;
  padding-top: 7px;
  padding-bottom: 7px;
  background: #FFF;
  font-size: 14px;
  color: #000;
  border: 1px solid #000;
}

.btn-size-two{
 width: 130px;
 padding-top: 5px;
 padding-bottom: 5px;
 background: #FFF;
 font-size: 14px;
 color: #000;
 border: 1px solid #000;
 border-radius: 6px;
}

.btn-size-three{
 width: 140px;
 padding-top: 5px;
 padding-bottom: 5px;
 background: #F6F6F6;
 font-size: 14px;
 color: #000;
 border: 1px solid #000;
 border-radius: 6px;
}

vs 
.btn{
 background: #F6F6F6;
 font-size: 14px;
 color: #000;
 border: 1px solid #000;
 border-radius: 6px;
}
.btn-one{
  width: 160px;
  padding-top: 7px;
  padding-bottom: 7px;
}
.btn-two{
  width: 140;
  padding-top: 5px;
  padding-bottom: 5px;
}

This allows consistent stlying in terms of font-size and background so you dont have to repeat code.
Also when you need to change the styling of the button its east since all btns will have the btn class.

This is what i learnt when trying to change the initial design to another one. I had to keep changing classes everywhere
and repeating the styling: Whenever a button length was too long i had to copy paste the existing style with a different width.

This new way will allow me to change the stlying in one place and just add custom class styles to different sets of elements all at the same time.

I'm looking to apply this same principal to containers and titles. These are the most likely to be the same style across all pages.
For custom elements the stlying will have to be customized for it since the layout will not be the same elsewhere.

This key since the style has to be consistent all across your website to prevent the user from being lost and wondering if its the same website or not.
