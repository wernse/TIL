For passwords

Uses one way hashing algorithms to prevent password security being compromised

-Problem is that MD-5 and SHA can be reverse engineered through dictionary lookups
People run these algorithms on every letter combination to find the hashed password
*Able to google the hash to find the unhashed value

Adding salt(random string) to the hashed value then hashing again will make it harder
Will need to find the unhashed (pw-hashed + salt) then unhash again. 
Even if salt is compromised it will still be difficult to lookup unhashed as they cant 
use the salt to unhash(one-way hashing)
