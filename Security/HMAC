MAC -  message authentication code
HMAC - Hashed message authentication code

MAC is a string of bits sent with message(message hashed with private key) to ensure a person
with the secret key(trusted) actually sent it
+significantly faster than HMAC
-lower security, hash can be found and mocked(salt+hash vs hash)

HMAC is a recipe for turning hash functions(SHA256/MD5) into MACs

You use HMAC whenever you want integrity of the data maintained (and authenticity)
Only requires secret key to ensure authentication
Used to ensure the message was not altered in between or by unauthorized party
Good for surveys where you have to link a url and cant add headers

*Requires shared secret key for trusted parties
*Hashes the message/data/url params with secret key
*Sends this as param with encoded msg e.g. ?stockNumber=1&survey=1&key=k3ja34ipa34pij3a4
*Can check if its authentic by running HMAC on the message and comparing it with the key provided

-If secret key compromised then messages then security breached
+Does not require DB/previous info to ensure message is authentic
+More secure then only auth on a shared secret, untrusted person can access any survey 

query parameter is less preferred since it may end up in logs and system process information, 
available to others that have access to the server or client system. 
In that case would be better to present it as part of a header or a POST parameter.
