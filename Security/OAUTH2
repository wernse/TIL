Standard for authorization whose main use case is managing authentication of users without sharing credentials 
e.g. login
Our app trusts facebook auth server, user doesnt need to ever enter password to our app

Used for access to user information on another server's API e.g. linkednn/facebook/googleacc
Getting their information, automatic logins without having to create a login

1.App requests auth to access resources from user
2.User authorizes the request for access and passes auth token
3.App requests access token from the auth server with auth token and app ID
4.If auth token and app ID are valid then pass access token
5.App can request from API with the access token
6.If valid then request access token

*access tokens have a valid life, can get a refresh token with access token
