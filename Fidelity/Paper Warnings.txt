People often change their mind when they see the built/functioning version of the product.
This causes us to have to rebuild/redesign things from the agreed paper prototype.

I can see why rapid interactive prototyping tools are usful
 -give the user an interactive but limited feel
This is often enough for the user to be happy with the final product but other problems may occur
when there is extended freedom(e.g more search categories)

Paper is good for inital design and feel
Interactive is good for use/feel or certain elements/pages
