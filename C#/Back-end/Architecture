Interactor entity model
The interactor-controller should be the "manager"
the entity - classes are the workers

Everytime a worker completes their job it should be sent to the manager to then 
send the job to the next worker rather than workers talking to each other
this allows us to change the worker if we wanted another functionality without having
to look through every single worker to see if they were communicating to each other(tightly coupled)
e.g. swapping out mongodb to sql

Interfaces allow this to happen, Dont have to change the manager's calls everytime the worker changes
The worker takes a static input and returns a static output
this is how multiple countries could buil the hubble telescope with just interfaces
