Need to add a Controller for every route to handle what the server will do when it rec thats url

Then Right click to add a view
This will create a file in the view folder correspoding to the same name
This is how it knows what view it will return

Controllers/RoutesDemoController
  public class RoutesDemoController : Controller
    {
        public ActionResult One()
        {
            return View(); //returns "one.cshtml" file
        }
    }
    
  Views/RoutesDemo/one.cshtml
  

For Attribute Routing
      [Route("/")]

public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
    routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

    routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes();

    // ...
}
