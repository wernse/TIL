Can bundle files together into a single file like concat
Have to include it into the view with 

BundleConfig.js
     bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/coreApp")
        .Include("~/Scripts/app.js")
        .IncludeDirectory("~/Scripts/Landing","*.js"));
        BundleTable.EnableOptimizations = true;
        
Index.cshtml 
    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/AwesomeAngularMVCApp")
